//! # Points
//!
//! A point is represented as the multivector
//! `$x\mathbf{e}_{032} + y\mathbf{e}_{013} + z\mathbf{e}_{021} +
//! \mathbf{e}_{123}$`.
//!
//! The point has a trivector representation because it is
//! the fixed point of 3 planar reflections (each of which is a grade-1 multivector).
//! In practice, the coordinate mapping can be thought of as an implementation detail.
