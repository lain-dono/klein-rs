//! # Planes
//!
//! In projective geometry, planes are the fundamental element through which all
//! other entities are constructed. Lines are the meet of two planes, and points
//! are the meet of three planes (equivalently, a line and a plane).
//!
//! The plane multivector in PGA looks like
//! $d\mathbf{e}_0 + a\mathbf{e}_1 + b\mathbf{e}_2 + c\mathbf{e}_3$. Points
//! that reside on the plane satisfy the familiar equation
//! $d + ax + by + cz = 0$.
